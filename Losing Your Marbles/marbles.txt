(Un) Losing Your Marbles

You've lost your marbles!! Actually you dropped 10 plastic marbles onto a play field. Build a robot to collect the marbles and deliver them to the home corner of the play field, sort of a Roomva for marbles. Each robot should be built by a team of two. "Gracious Professionalism" should be practiced toward your team mate and to the other teams as you share a common play field. Points will be awarded as follows: 
Each run is 60 seconds.

Robot must be fully contained within the home area (the quarter circle) at the beginning of a mission.
Up to three points for creativity. This can be the design of the robot, team name, robot name, strategy, etc. There will be a show-and-tell portion to show off your creations. 

Up to three points for efficiency (measured by time remaining after robot stops moving.)

Up to four points for "gracious professionalism" (work together as a team, work with other teams, work with adults).

Score is best of three runs.
