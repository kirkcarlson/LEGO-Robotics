This repository contains a series of LEGO Spike Essentials prompts. A prompt simply provides basic instructions for a building and programming activity.

The intent is to learn by playing. Most of this activities focus on programming since most kids can build many things at home (although the Technics parts do offer additional challenges).

The .pdf version is ready to print. The .odt file is an OpenOffice text source file.

Some exercises include the graphics files used as well as the LeoDraw/LDraw files for the build instructions.
